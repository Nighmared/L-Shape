			<h1>L-Shape</h1>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The Code linked below was created as a consequence of a given task, that required a general idea of how the Problem could be solved. In Pseudocode for that matter. The code overengineers this task, outputting a graphical representation of the solution using matplotlib<br>
			The following requirements were given
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Input: the dimensions of a 2<sup>k</sup>x2<sup>k</sup> square of 1x1 fields and the position of an initially marked field</li>
				<li>Output: The square described above filled with 3-Tile L-Shapes</li>
				<li>Additional: The algorithm has to be divide-and-conquer</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Code is not Embedded into this site by default, as by the many lines it makes for a rather unaestethic look. A mildly reduced form of the Source code can however be displayed <button id="button1" onclick="showcode('here','button1');">Show Code</button></p>
